# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-CNNs-on-MNIST-Dataset
This project classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow. A Streamlit web app allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions. The model is trained to achieve high accuracy, and evaluation metrics like precision and recall are provided for performance insights
